# carousel-bootstrap-vanillajs

it is a simple carousel loading data from JSON file (i could be loaded directly from the REST API , but it has to be cross domaine allowed )
I have used the following tools :

##ES6 :
 Very easily to write code in modern ECMAScript 6 standards  
Yo ( Yoaman ) : to scaffold my project easily to a structured folder using file generating and configurations

##Webpack :
 A very handy module bundler  and  task manager i have used it to implement SASS , and Babel from ES6 to ES5  Javascript supported in all browsers , as well from watching file changes , run and build my project .

##Sass : i have used sass to override some bootstrap variables ,set my own variables and have more dynamic css .

##Bootstrap 3 :
just to exploit the power of bootstrap especially in layout and skinning using less or sass .


I have only used native javascript ( Vanilla ) in my code to  load JSON , manipulate the DOM , and control the Carousel ( no JQuery ) , there is also another version that i made without bootstrap at all , Only sass , and ES6 You can check it here .[Sass/ES6 Carousel code]  (https://github.com/chakAs3/carousel-sass-es6)
